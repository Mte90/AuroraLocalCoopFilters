# AuroraLocalCoopFilters

The idea behind is to create a generator of Aurora Lua filters by using data from various sources to be able to filter games that let you to play local in coop with friends.  
The code can be modified to generate also for multiplayer in case.  

To download the Lua filters checks in the repo Releases (put the Lua files inside the `Aurora/User/Scripts/Content/Filters/` folder, the Aurora main folder can change based on your installation).

## Ispiration:

* https://github.com/Swizzy/AuroraScripts/
* 

## How works

* Scrape data from Co-Optimus and Wikipedia generating txt files that include Games name
* Later this files (with the player numbers) are associated with TitleID
* Generate LUA scripts that includes those TitleID (with the `manual_*.txt`) with removing duplicates

The reason is that as today those data are not gathered anymore from Xbox or are incomplete, so we need a bit of Python to achieve it.

### What we need

* `titlecache.list` generated by Aurora
* CSV of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cooperative_video_games) page that can be generated with [this](https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/)
* Internet
