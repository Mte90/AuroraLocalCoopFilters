The idea behind is to create a generator of Aurora Lua filters by using data from various sources to be able to filter games that let you to play local in coop with friends.  
The code can be modified to generate also for multiplayer in case.  

To download the Lua filters [checks in the repo Releases](https://github.com/Mte90/AuroraLocalCoopFilters/releases) (put the Lua files inside the `Aurora/User/Scripts/Content/Filters/` folder, the `Aurora` main folder can change based on your installation).

## Inspiration:

* https://github.com/Swizzy/AuroraScripts/
* https://www.realmodscene.com/index.php?/topic/6371-local-co-op-co-op-4-player-multiplayer-scripts/&tab=comments#comment-54099 (used to generate the `manual_*.txt` files)

## How works

* Scrape data from Co-Optimus and Wikipedia generating txt files that include Games name
* Later this files (with the player numbers) are associated with TitleID
* Generate LUA scripts that includes those TitleID (with the `manual_*.txt` that is a TitleID list human made) with removing duplicates

The reason is that as today those data are not gathered anymore from Xbox or are incomplete, so we need a bit of Python to achieve it.

### What we need

* `titlecache.list` generated by Aurora
* CSV of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cooperative_video_games) page that can be generated with [this](https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/)
* Internet

## Results

From Wikipedia:

```
Found 175 Xbox 360 games.
Found 93 2 Coop games.
Found 36 4+ Coop games.
1 games to manually define.
21 2 Coop games not identified.
11 4+ Coop games not identified. 
```

From Co-optimus:

```
Found 345 2 Coop games.
Found 144 4+ Coop games.
112 2 Coop games not identified.
46 4+ Coop games not identified.
```

From Lua filter generator:

```
For 2 players we found 475 games.
For 4 players we found 181 games.
```

### Why is not detecting all of them?

Every source write the game name in a different way so a match is very difficult. The scripts try a normalization to get more matches but cannot identify all of them.
